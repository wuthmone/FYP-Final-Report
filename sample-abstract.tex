Artificial Neuron Network (ANN) is one of the methods which has been widely used in forecasting the financial market.  In this project, an ensemble ANN model is used to forecast the currency exchange rate between Malaysian Ringgit and other currencies. The ensemble ANN models are constructed with homogeneous neural networks such as Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) using different algorithms and also with heterogeneous neural networks such as MLPs, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Radial Basis  Function network (RBF).

The optimal structure for each neural network is found by modifying the different parameters such as number of input nodes, number of hidden nodes, activation functions for the hidden and output layers, training algorithms, error functions etc. The models are trained three different training ratio, such as 80\%,70\%, and 60\%. The performance of the models are compared against each other. The project concludes that the homogeneous ensemble which trained with 60\% training inputs data yield the best accuracy performance for all the currencies.
