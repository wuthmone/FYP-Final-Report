\section{Conclusion}
In this project, an ensemble ANN model is constructed to forecast the exchange rates from Malaysian Ringgit to the six currencies. The two ensemble models are constructed and compared with the single ANN models. The models are trained with three different ratio.  The performance accuracy of USD with homogeneous ensemble models which trained with 60\% training inputs data is better than the current literature performance. The project concludes that the homogeneous ensemble which trained with 60\% training inputs data yield the best accuracy performance for all the currencies.
